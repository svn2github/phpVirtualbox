12.1 Incompatible API changes with version 4.3


---- DONE  The parameter list of IAppliance::write() has been changed slightly, to allow multiple flags
to be passed.

--Done  IMachine::delete has been renamed to IMachine::deleteConfig(), to improve API client
binding compatibility.

--Done  IMachine::export has been renamed to IMachine::exportTo(), to improve API client
binding compatibility.

-- N/A  For IMachine::launchVMProcess() the meaning of the type parameter has changed slightly.
Empty string now means that the per-VM or global default frontend is launched. Most
callers of this method should use the empty string now, unless they really want to override
the default and launch a particular frontend.

        )

 Medium management APIs were changed as follows:
‚Äì The type of attribute IMedium::variant() changed from unsigned long to
safe-array MediumVariant. It is an array of flags instead of a set of flags which
were stored inside one variable.

)


-- Done, not tested‚Äì The parameter list for IMedium::cloneTo() was modified. The type of parameter variant
was changed from unsigned long to safe-array MediumVariant.

-- Done, not tested‚Äì The parameter list for IMedium::createBaseStorage() was modified. The type of parameter
variant was changed from unsigned long to safe-array MediumVariant.

--N/A‚Äì The parameter list for IMedium::createDiffStorage() was modified. The type of parameter
variant was changed from unsigned long to safe-array MediumVariant.

-‚Äì N/A The parameter list for IMedium::cloneToBase() was modified. The type of parameter
variant was changed from unsigned long to safe-array MediumVariant.

-- BROKEN just like medium formats
 The type of attribute IMediumFormat::capabilities() changed from unsigned long to
safe-array MediumFormatCapabilities. It is an array of flags instead of a set of flags
which were stored inside one variable.

-- N/A  The attribute IMedium::logicalSize() now returns the logical size of exactly this medium
object (whether it is a base or diff image). The old behavior was no longer acceptable, as
each image can have a different capacity.

-- N/A  Guest control APIs - such as IGuest, IGuestSession, IGuestProcess and so on - now emit
own events to provide clients much finer control and the ability to write own frontends for
guest operations. The event IGuestSessionEvent acts as an abstract base class for all guest
control events. Certain guest events contain a IVirtualBoxErrorInfo member to provide
more information in case of an error happened on the guest side.

-- N/A  Guest control sessions on the guest started by IGuest::createSession() now are dedicated
guest processes to provide more safety and performance for certain operations. Also, the
IGuest::createSession() call does not wait for the guest session being created anymore due
to the dedicated guest session processes just mentioned. This also will enable webservice
clients to handle guest session creation more gracefully. To wait for a guest session being
started, use the newly added attribute IGuestSession::status() to query the current guest
session status.

-- N/A  The IGuestFile APIs are now implemented to provide native guest file access from the host.

-- Done, need to test  The parameter list for IMedium::updateGuestAdditions() was modified. It now supports
specifying optional command line arguments for the Guest Additions installer performing
the actual update on the guest.

-- N/A  A new event IGuestUserStateChangedEvent was introduced to provide guest user status
updates to the host via event listeners. To use this event there needs to be at least the 4.3
Guest Additions installed on the guest. At the moment only the states ‚ÄúIdle‚Äù and ‚ÄúInUse‚Äù
of the GuestUserState enum are supported on Windows guests, starting at Windows 2000
SP2.

-- N/A  The attribute IGuestSession::protocolVersion was added to provide a convenient way to
lookup the guest session‚Äôs protocol version it uses to communicate with the installed Guest
Additions on the guest. Older Guest Additions will set the protocol version to 1, whereas
Guest Additions 4.3 will set the protocol version to 2. This might change in the future as
new features arise.

-- N/A  IDisplay::getScreenResolution has been extended to return the display position in
the guest.

--- Need to implement in GUI and save settings  The IUSBController class is not a singleton of IMachine anymore but IMachine contains
a list of USB controllers present in the VM. The USB device filter handling was moved to
IUSBDeviceFilters.
