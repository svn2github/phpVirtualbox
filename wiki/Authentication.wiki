= Introduction =

*NOTE: This covers authentication within the phpVirtualBox application. If you are getting an error message that states "Error logging in to vboxwebsrv," please see the [http://code.google.com/p/phpvirtualbox/wiki/CommonErrors#Error_logging_in_or_connecting_to_vboxwebsrv Common Errors and Issues] wiki.

Authentication was introduced in phpVirtualBox 4.0-4. If you are using an older version, these features will not be available.


= Logging in for the first time =

When you navigate to phpVirtualBox, you may be presented with a Log in form.

[http://phpvirtualbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/authlogin.png]

The default credentials are username: admin password: admin

Once logged in, you should change the default password through File -> Change Password.

Using the change password form.

= Configuring Users =

You may configure users in the File -> Preferences -> Users section of phpVirtualBox.

[http://phpvirtualbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/authusers.png]

This section allows you to add, edit, and remove users. Access levels and authentication is very basic at the moment.

== Access Levels ==

phpVirtualBox essentially has two access levels. Admin users and non-admin users. Admin users have access to the Users section of phpVirtualBox and can add / edit / remove other users.

= Password Recovery =

You may reset the admin password by renaming the file *recovery.php-disabled* in phpVirtualBox's folder to *recovery.php* and navigating to it in your web browser. E.g. http://HOST-OR-IP/phpvirtualbox/recovery.php

This page will present you with a simple form. Click on the *Recover* button to reset the admin user's password back to the default of *admin*. If you have removed the admin account, it will be recreated.

Once this is done, rename *recovery.php* back to *recovery.php-disabled*. phpVirtualBox will refuse to run while *recovery.php* exists. You may then log in with the default credentials of *admin* / *admin*.

= Disabling Authentication =

If you want to disable authentication in phpVirtualBox, add the following line to *config.php*:

{{{
var $noAuth = true;
}}}

Once this is done, no username / password will be required to access phpVirtualBox. Additionally, sections of phpVirtualBox pertaining to authentication (Change Password, Users, etc.) will not be visible.

= Multiple Server Considerations =

If you have phpVirtualBox configured to communicate with multiple VirtualBox installations, please see the authentication notes provided in the [http://code.google.com/p/phpvirtualbox/wiki/MultipleServerConfiguration#Multiple_servers_and_Authentication Multiple Server Configuration wiki].
