=Error Messages=

== Error logging in or connecting to vboxwebsrv==

This typically indicates that the username and / or password is incorrect in config.php. These must be set to the system username / password of the user that administers your VirtualBox virtual machines.

If you have upgraded from VirtualBox 3.2.x and this was working before, you may have to run the following commands on your VirtualBox host:

   VBoxManage setproperty vrdeauthlibrary default

   VBoxManage setproperty websrvauthlibrary default

== Could not connect to host ==

This indicates that phpVirtualBox could not connect to the vboxwebsrv server. Either the *location* setting in config.php is wrong or *vboxwebsrv* is not running on the VirtualBox host.
