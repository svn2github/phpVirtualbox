=Error Messages=

== Error logging in or connecting to vboxwebsrv==

This typically indicates that the username and / or password is incorrect in config.php. These must be set to the system username / password of the user that administers your VirtualBox virtual machines.

*If you have upgraded from VirtualBox 3.2.x and this was working before*, you may have to run the following commands on your VirtualBox host:

   VBoxManage setproperty vrdeauthlibrary default

   VBoxManage setproperty websrvauthlibrary default

== Could not connect to host ==

This indicates that phpVirtualBox could not connect to the vboxwebsrv server. Either the *location* setting in config.php is wrong or *vboxwebsrv* is not running on the VirtualBox host.


== looks like we got no XML document ==

This message occurs when the $location setting in config.php is incorrect. The most common cause is that it is set to the location of phpVirtualBox rather than the SOAP URL of vboxwebsrv.

There are 2 locations involved. One is the URL that phpVirtualBox is accessible through, and the other is the URL through which phpVirtualBox communicates with vboxwebsrv. The $location setting in config.php needs to be set to the URL to vboxwebsrv.

The setting probably looks something like this:

{{{
var $location = 'http://localhost/phpvirtualbox/';
}}}

but needs to look like this:

{{{
var $location = 'http://127.0.0.1:18083/';
}}}

The URL through which phpVirtualBox is accessible does not need to be specified.

== The virtual machine 'vm name' has terminated unexpectedly during startup ==

This is usually an indication of some sort of misconfiguration of the VM. For instance you may have enabled "Enable VT-x/AMD-V" in the VM's configuration, but your processor does not support it (just an example). Unfortunately the only way to get the correct error message is to start the VM using another VirtualBox interface such as the VirtualBox GUI, VBoxManage, or VBoxHeadless. These should print a more descriptive error.

If the cause is not apparent through the error message, post the issue on the forums over at http://www.virtualbox.org

== Method 'ns1:xxxxxxxxxxx' not implemented: method name or namespace not recognized ==

You are probably using a version of phpVirtualBox that is incompatible with your version of VirtualBox. 

phpVirtualBox versioning is aligned with VirtualBox versioning in that the major and minor release numbers will maintain compatibility. phpVirtualBox 4.0-x will only be compatible with VirtualBox 4.0.x. Regardless of what the latest x revision is. phpVirtualBox 4.1-x will only be compatible with VirtualBox 4.1.x. ..etc..

Download and install the correct version of phpVirtualBox, restart apache, and clear your web browser's cache.

== Function ("xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx") is not a valid method for this service ==

The short answer is to restart apache.

PHP caches the WSDL file for vboxwebsrv and is still using an older version. The default cache timeout set in php.ini is 1 day. Restarting apache should force PHP to refresh this file.

== Undefined method: xxxxxxxxx ==

You have probably upgraded phpVirtualBox and not cleared your web browser's cache. The version in your web browser's cache does not match the version on the server. Clear your browser's cache and refresh the page.

=Issues=

== Empty virtual machine list ==

This is usually an indication that the username / password entered in config.php is not that of the user that administers your VirtualBox virtual machines.

== Preview Box only shows VM name. Even when the VM is running. ==
	- or -
== Console Tab is ALWAYS disabled ==

To enable screen shots and the Console tab, please install a VirtualBox extension pack that supports VRDE such as the Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack found in the Downloads section of http://www.virtualbox.org

== Right click menu is displayed under context menu on VM Details tab when using Firefox ==

In Firefox, click on the Tools menu -> Options -> Content -> Advanced (next to Enable JavaScript), and enable the Disable or replace context menus option.

== Preview Box is Black and VM is running / saved ==

The power or screen saver settings of the guest OS in the virtual machine is probably set to turn off the monitor or display a blank screen after a period of inactivity. Change this setting in the guest operating system of the virtual machine.
