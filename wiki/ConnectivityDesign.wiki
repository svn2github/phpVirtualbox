#summary Connectivity Design of phpVirtualBox

Some people may have trouble understanding the design of phpVirtualBox and how it interacts with VirtualBox. The connectivity diagram below should aid in understanding of its interaction and why *user X* (the VirtualBox user that administers your VirtualBox installation) must be configured.

<pre>
 -----------------------------------------------------
 | Web Server                                        |
 |    phpVirtualBox (config.php contains user X's    |
 |     |              system username / password)    |
 ------|----------------------------------------------
       |
   Authentication and VirtualBox communication
       |
       |  -----------------------------------------------
       |  | VirtualBox Installation                     |
       |  |                                             |
       '---- vboxwebsrv (running as user X)             |
          |    |                                        |
          |    '--- User X's VirtualBox configuration   |
          |         and virtual machines                |
          |                                             |
          -----------------------------------------------

_Note that although the web server and VirtualBox installation are in 2 different boxes in the diagram, they certainly may run on the same physical host._
