The connectivity diagram below should aid in understanding of its interaction and why *user X* (the VirtualBox user that administers your VirtualBox installation) must be properly configured.

          |         and virtual machines                |
          |                                             |

_Note that although the web server and VirtualBox installation are in 2 different boxes in the diagram, they certainly may run on the same physical host. Taking security considerations in mind, they probably should run on the same host._
