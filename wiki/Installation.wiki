#summary Installation of phpVirtualBox

= VirtualBox Considerations =

phpVirtualBox requires that vboxwebsrv (a program distributed with VirtualBox) is running on your VirtualBox host. On `*`nix hosts, this is typically found in /usr/bin. On Windows, it is typically found in C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox. This program MUST be run as the same user that administers your VirtualBox virtual machines. On Windows and OS X, this simply means the same user that you log into your machine as when you run VirtualBox.

==Unix/Linux==

Assuming your VirtualBox installation is run by the user *vbox* and vboxwebsrv is located in /usr/bin, you may start vboxwebsrv by running the following command as *vbox*:

 /usr/bin/vboxwebsrv -b --logfile /dev/null >/dev/null

Alternatively you may run the command as root by using *su*. Assuming your VirtualBox installation is run by the user *vbox* and vboxwebsrv is located in /usr/bin, you may start vboxwebsrv by running the following command as *root*:

 su vbox -c '/usr/bin/vboxwebsrv -b --logfile /dev/null >/dev/null'

This command can also be placed in a system startup script. *See the Downloads tab for an example init.d startup script.*

==Windows==

On Windows (assuming your VirtualBox installation is located in C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox), the following command will start vboxwebsrv:

 "C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\vboxwebsrv.exe" >nul

Note that *>nul* is needed so that vboxwebsrv does not send its output to the command prompt window. Without it, performance will be severely degraded.

==OS X==
TODO: Install VirtualBox on OS X and create instructions.
