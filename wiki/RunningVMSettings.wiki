= Introduction =

Many of the same modifications that can be made through the VirtualBox GUI when a virtual machine is running, can also be made through phpVirtualBox by selecting the VM in the VM list and clicking on the Settings button. This behaves much like the Devices menu in the window of a running virtual machine in the VirtualBox GUI.

To change network adapter settings of a running VM, click on the Network header link.

Note that some properties cannot be changed while a VM is running. These items are disabled in the Network Adapter settings window.

= Shared Folders =

To change folders shared to a running VM, click on the Shared Folders header link.

Note that only permanent ("Machine") folders will be listed on the Details tab. For more information regarding transient and machine shared folders, reference the Shared Folders section of the VirtualBox documentation.
