= Introduction =

Many of the same modifications that can be made through the VirtualBox GUI when a virtual machine is running, can also be made through phpVirtualBox by selecting the VM in the VM list and clicking on the Settings button. This behaves much like the Devices menu in the window of a running virtual machine within VirtaulBox.

These are also accessible by clicking on the appropriate item on the Details tab as described below.

= Removable (CD/DVD and Floppy) Media =

To mount removable media to a running VM, click on the name of the current media (or the word Empty) in the Storage Controllers section. This will bring up the Mount dialog which will allow you to select a medium, a host drive, or to eject medium by selecting Remove disk from virtual drive.

Note that some properties cannot be changed while a VM is running. These items are disabled in the Network Adapter settings window.

= Shared Folders =

To change folders shared to a running VM, click on the Shared Folders header link.

Note that only permanent ("Machine") folders will be listed on the Details tab. For more information regarding transient and machine shared folders, reference the Shared Folders section of the VirtualBox documentation.

= USB Devices =

To attach / detach USB devices to a running VM, click on the USB header link. Select or deselect the Attached check box, and click OK.

Only available USB devices can be attached to a virtual machine.
