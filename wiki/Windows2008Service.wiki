#summary Start vboxwebsrv as "service" in Windows 7 / Server 2008 / Vista

= Introduction =

The following is user-contributed documentation. I am unable to verify the validity of these instructions.


= Details =

1) install VirtualBox

2) menu start --> administrative tools --> task scheduler

3) create a new task

4) put name and description. Under security option, click on "change user or group", *if needed to select the user VirtualBox is supposed to run as*. Than select "run whatever the user is log on or not" and check the box "hidden"

5) tab triggers --> new --> begin the task: At startup

6) tab Actions --> new --> Action : start a program
   Program Script : browse to find an select vboxwebsrv (suppose to be in C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox

7) DO NOT ADD ARGUMENTS

8) check tabs conditions and settings for custom choices

9) Also don't forget to make a directory junction, as suggested in comment #10 http://code.google.com/p/phpvirtualbox/issues/detail?id=43#c10

If you don't do this, all your VMs will be inacessible

Directory junction has to be created using this command (replace [username] with your user profile name)
C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile>mklink /j .Virtualbox C:\Users\[username]\.VirtualBox

10) have fun, test rebooting your machine
